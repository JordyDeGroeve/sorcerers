# Sorcerers

Sorcerers is a worms-inspired turn based multiplayer game that runs fully in the browser with a magic theme.\
The game supports both local multiplayer and peer to peer connections between players.\
If you're feeling creative there's a [simple map builder](https://lorgan3.github.io/sorcerers/#/builder) to build and play your own maps, feel free to open an issue/pull request to get it added to the game!
